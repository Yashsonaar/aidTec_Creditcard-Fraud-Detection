# aidTec_Creditcard-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains 3rd task of my Machine Learning Internship offered by Info Aidtech. My third task was to create credit card fraud detection system using Suppervised Classifiers like SVM or Logistic Regression.. I have implemented this project using SVM Algorithm as it works for Big Dataset also..as well as efficient. I hope you like my work...

NOTE : Download Credit Card Fraud Dataset..then open project....
